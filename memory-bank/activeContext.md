- 📄 NEW: `src/utils/profile.js` - Profile management utilities
- ✏️ MODIFIED: `src/navigation/AppNavigator.js` - Added username gating logic

### Previous Completed Work

**PR #1-3:**

- ✅ React Native setup with Expo
- ✅ Firebase configuration (Auth, Firestore, Realtime DB, Storage)
- ✅ 3 Zustand stores (local, presence, firebase)
- ✅ Authentication screens (Login, Signup)
- ✅ Design system components (Button, Input, Card)
- ✅ Auth utility functions with error handling

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### New: AI Agent as Conversation Architecture (PR #16)

**Decision:** Implement the AI agent as a pinned conversation at the top of HomeScreen, rather than as separate screens/modals.

**Implementation:**

- AI agent appears as a static user object (not a real Firebase user)
- Always pinned at top of HomeScreen with distinct visual styling
- Uses existing ChatScreen UI for all interactions
- Messages route to `/api/agent` backend endpoint instead of Firebase
- Responses stream back in real-time like normal chat messages

**Rationale:**

- **Familiar UX**: Users already understand chat interface
- **Code Reuse**: No need for separate AgentChatScreen - reuses ChatScreen
- **Natural Integration**: AI feels like a team member, not a bolt-on feature
- **Scalable**: Easy to add more AI capabilities through conversation
- **Simplified Architecture**: One chat interface for everything

**Evolution Path:**

- PR #14: Build Summary/Action Items as separate buttons (quick wins)
- PR #16: Create AI agent conversation AND refactor buttons to use it (complete transition)
- Result: All AI features use unified conversational interface by end of PR #16

This creates a more unified and intuitive user experience for all AI features.

### Username-Gating Pattern

**Decision:** Username is the single source of truth for profile completion

- **Check:** On auth state change, fetch Firestore user document
- **Gate:** If no username exists, show ProfileSetupScreen
- **Flow:** ProfileSetupScreen → creates user document with username → Home screen
- **Future Enhancement:** Strict gating to prevent access to other screens (will add in later PR)

**Rationale:**

- Username is unique and permanent (cannot be changed)
- Simple boolean check: has username = profile complete
- Display name and profile picture are optional enhancements

### Architecture Decisions

- **3-Store Pattern**: Confirmed use of Local Store + Presence Store + Firebase Store
- **Firebase Services**: Firestore for data, Realtime Database for presence, Storage for images
- **Expo Managed Workflow**: Chosen for simplified development and deployment
- **Manual Testing**: No automated tests for MVP timeline
- **Username as Profile Gate**: Username existence = profile completion check

### Technical Priorities

1. **Reliability First**: Message delivery and status tracking must be perfect
2. **Real-time Performance**: <500ms message latency, <100ms presence updates
3. **Offline Support**: Firestore offline persistence + optimistic updates
4. **Cross-platform**: Consistent experience on iOS and Android

### Implementation Strategy

- **Sequential PRs**: 12 PRs building incrementally from foundation to advanced features
- **Physical Device Testing**: Test on real devices after every PR
- **Offline Testing**: Constant airplane mode testing for message queuing
- **Presence Testing**: Multi-device testing for online/offline status

## Current Blockers and Risks

### Identified Risks

1. **React Native Learning Curve**: First-time React Native development
   - **Mitigation**: Use Expo managed workflow, leverage React knowledge
2. **Firebase Complexity**: Real-time + Realtime Database integration
   - **Mitigation**: Start simple, test early, use proven patterns
3. **7-Day Timeline**: Aggressive timeline for full-featured app
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on core messaging first, AI features last
4. **Cross-platform Testing**: iOS and Android differences
   - **Mitigation**: Test on both platforms from day 1

### No Current Blockers

- All required documentation is in place
- Clear implementation path defined
- Dependencies and tools identified
- Architecture patterns established
