# Active Context: Mobile Messaging App

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: **Planning Phase**

The project is currently in the initial planning and setup phase. The memory bank has been established with comprehensive documentation covering project requirements, technical architecture, and implementation strategy.

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **PR #1**: React Native Setup & Environment Configuration
2. **PR #2**: Firebase Configuration & Zustand Stores
3. **PR #3**: Authentication (Signup & Login)
4. **PR #4**: Profile Setup & User Creation in Firestore
5. **PR #5**: User List & Presence Tracking

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Initialization

- ✅ Created comprehensive project brief with MVP requirements
- ✅ Documented product context and user experience goals
- ✅ Established system patterns with 3-store architecture
- ✅ Defined technical context and development environment
- ✅ Analyzed existing design system components (Button, Card, Input)

### Project Analysis

- ✅ Reviewed PRD.md with detailed implementation requirements
- ✅ Examined tasks.md with 12 PR breakdown and timeline
- ✅ Analyzed architecture.mermaid diagram
- ✅ Studied existing design system components
- ✅ Identified package.json with basic project structure

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

- **3-Store Pattern**: Confirmed use of Local Store + Presence Store + Firebase Store
- **Firebase Services**: Firestore for data, Realtime Database for presence, Storage for images
- **Expo Managed Workflow**: Chosen for simplified development and deployment
- **Manual Testing**: No automated tests for MVP timeline

### Technical Priorities

1. **Reliability First**: Message delivery and status tracking must be perfect
2. **Real-time Performance**: <500ms message latency, <100ms presence updates
3. **Offline Support**: Firestore offline persistence + optimistic updates
4. **Cross-platform**: Consistent experience on iOS and Android

### Implementation Strategy

- **Sequential PRs**: 12 PRs building incrementally from foundation to advanced features
- **Physical Device Testing**: Test on real devices after every PR
- **Offline Testing**: Constant airplane mode testing for message queuing
- **Presence Testing**: Multi-device testing for online/offline status

## Current Blockers and Risks

### Identified Risks

1. **React Native Learning Curve**: First-time React Native development
   - **Mitigation**: Use Expo managed workflow, leverage React knowledge
2. **Firebase Complexity**: Real-time + Realtime Database integration
   - **Mitigation**: Start simple, test early, use proven patterns
3. **7-Day Timeline**: Aggressive timeline for full-featured app
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on core messaging first, AI features last
4. **Cross-platform Testing**: iOS and Android differences
   - **Mitigation**: Test on both platforms from day 1

### No Current Blockers

- All required documentation is in place
- Clear implementation path defined
- Dependencies and tools identified
- Architecture patterns established

## Next Implementation Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1 - Hours 0-8)

**Goal**: Get authentication and basic navigation working

**Immediate Tasks**:

- [ ] Set up React Native project with Expo (`npx create-expo-app`)
- [ ] Install dependencies: Zustand, Firebase, React Navigation
- [ ] Set up Firebase project (Auth + Firestore + Realtime Database + Storage)
- [ ] Create 3 Zustand stores (localStore, presenceStore, firebaseStore)
- [ ] Implement signup flow (email + password only)
- [ ] Implement profile setup screen (username, displayName, optional photo/bio)
- [ ] Implement login flow
- [ ] Create user profile document on signup (Firestore)
- [ ] Create presence entry on login (Realtime Database)
- [ ] Basic navigation (Auth screens ↔ Home screen)

**Checkpoint**: Users can sign up, complete profile, log in, and see Home screen

### Phase 2: User Profiles & Presence (Day 1 - Hours 8-16)

**Goal**: Complete user profiles and presence tracking

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Build Profile screen (view/edit current user)
- [ ] Implement profile photo upload (Firebase Storage)
- [ ] Save imageURL to Firestore user document
- [ ] Build User List (Home screen)
- [ ] Fetch all users from Firestore → FIREBASE store
- [ ] Listen to Realtime Database `/presence` → PRESENCE store
- [ ] Display users with online/offline indicators
- [ ] Update presence on app foreground/background
- [ ] Implement `.onDisconnect()` for auto-offline
- [ ] Test presence with 2 devices

**Checkpoint**: Can create profile, upload photo, see all users with accurate presence

## Key Implementation Notes

### Design System Integration

- Existing design system components (Button, Card, Input) are well-structured
- Components use design tokens for consistency
- Ready to be adapted for React Native (StyleSheet instead of CSS)
- Focus on mobile-first design patterns

### Firebase Configuration Priority

- Set up Firebase project first
- Configure all services (Auth, Firestore, Realtime DB, Storage)
- Test Firebase connection before building UI
- Implement security rules early

### Testing Strategy

- **Physical Devices**: Use Expo Go app on real phones
- **Multi-device Testing**: Test presence and messaging with 2+ devices
- **Offline Testing**: Constant airplane mode testing
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor message latency and status updates

## Questions to Resolve

### Technical Questions

- [ ] **App name**: What should we call it? (not "WhatsApp Clone")
- [ ] **Color scheme**: Primary/accent colors for UI
- [ ] **AI features priority**: Chat assistant first or summaries first?
- [ ] **Username search**: Implement before or after AI agent?
- [ ] **Platform priority**: Test iOS first, Android first, or both simultaneously?
- [ ] **Push notification sound**: Custom sound or system default?
- [ ] **Message retention**: Keep all messages forever or limit to X days?

### Implementation Questions

- [ ] **Firebase project naming**: What to call the Firebase project?
- [ ] **Environment setup**: Local development vs cloud development?
- [ ] **Design system adaptation**: How to convert web components to React Native?
- [ ] **Testing devices**: Which devices to use for testing?

## Success Criteria for Next Phase

### Phase 1 Success (Foundation)

- ✅ Expo project created and runs on device
- ✅ Firebase project configured with all services
- ✅ 3 Zustand stores created and accessible
- ✅ Authentication flow working (signup → profile setup → login)
- ✅ Basic navigation between auth and main screens
- ✅ User documents created in Firestore
- ✅ Presence entries created in Realtime Database

### Phase 2 Success (Profiles & Presence)

- ✅ Profile screen allows editing and photo upload
- ✅ Home screen shows all users with presence indicators
- ✅ Presence updates accurately in real-time
- ✅ Online/offline status displays correctly
- ✅ App state changes update presence properly
- ✅ Multi-device presence testing works

## Resource Requirements

### Development Tools

- **Node.js**: v18 or later
- **Expo CLI**: Global installation
- **Firebase CLI**: For Cloud Functions deployment
- **EAS CLI**: For production builds

### Testing Devices

- **iOS Device**: iPhone with Expo Go app
- **Android Device**: Android phone with Expo Go app
- **Simulator/Emulator**: For development testing

### External Services

- **Firebase Project**: Free tier sufficient for MVP
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4 access for AI features
- **Expo Account**: For deployment and testing

## Timeline Awareness

### Critical Path

- **Day 1**: Foundation + Profiles & Presence
- **Day 2**: Messaging Core + MVP Polish
- **Day 3-4**: Group Chats + Push Notifications
- **Day 5**: AI Agent Basic Integration
- **Day 6-7**: AI Advanced Features + Final Polish

### Risk Mitigation

- **Start with core messaging**: Ensure reliable foundation
- **Test early and often**: Don't wait until end to test
- **Focus on MVP first**: AI features are nice-to-have
- **Use proven patterns**: Don't reinvent the wheel
