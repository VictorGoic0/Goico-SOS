# PR #4: Profile Setup & User Creation - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview

Implemented the profile setup flow with username-gating pattern. Users complete their profile once after signup, and the username serves as the check for profile completion.

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. ProfileSetupScreen (`src/screens/ProfileSetupScreen.js`)

**Features:**

- ✅ Username input (REQUIRED)
  - Validation: 3-20 characters, alphanumeric + underscore
  - Uniqueness check against Firestore
  - Stored as lowercase for consistency
- ✅ Display Name input (OPTIONAL)
  - Defaults to username if not provided
  - Max 50 characters
- ✅ Bio input (OPTIONAL)
  - Multiline text area
  - Max 200 characters
- ✅ Profile Picture upload (OPTIONAL)
  - Uses expo-image-picker
  - Square crop (1:1 aspect ratio)
  - Uploads to Firebase Storage
- ✅ Form validation with real-time error display
- ✅ Loading states during submission
- ✅ Helpful info messages about username permanence

### 2. Profile Utilities (`src/utils/profile.js`)

**Functions:**

```javascript
// Get user profile from Firestore
getUserProfile(userId);

// Create new user profile
createUserProfile({ username, displayName, bio, imageUri });

// Update existing profile
updateUserProfile(userId, updates);

// Check username uniqueness
checkUsernameExists(username);

// Upload profile image to Storage
uploadProfileImage(userId, imageUri);

// Get all users (for PR #5)
getAllUsers();
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Username validation and uniqueness checking
- ✅ Profile image upload to Firebase Storage
- ✅ Firestore user document creation
- ✅ Error handling with specific error codes
- ✅ Graceful image upload failure (continues without image)

### 3. Updated AppNavigator (`src/navigation/AppNavigator.js`)

**Username-Gating Logic:**

```
User logs in
    ↓
Fetch user document from Firestore
    ↓
Check if username exists
    ↓
No username? → ProfileSetupScreen
Has username? → Home Screen
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Async profile check on auth state change
- ✅ Loading screen while fetching profile
- ✅ Conditional navigation based on username
- ✅ Merges Firestore data with auth user object
- ✅ Updates store with complete user data

## 🔐 Firestore Schema

### User Document: `/users/{userId}`

```javascript
{
  userId: string,           // Firebase Auth UID
  username: string,         // REQUIRED - unique, lowercase, 3-20 chars
  displayName: string,      // Display name or username fallback
  email: string,            // From Firebase Auth
  imageURL: string | null,  // Firebase Storage download URL
  bio: string | null,       // Optional bio (max 200 chars)
  status: string,           // Default: "Available"
  pushToken: string | null, // For push notifications (PR #8)
  createdAt: timestamp,     // Server timestamp
  lastEdit: timestamp       // Server timestamp
}
```

## 🚀 User Flow

### New User Journey

1. **Sign Up** → Creates Firebase Auth account
2. **Auto Navigate** → ProfileSetupScreen shown
3. **Complete Profile**:
   - Enter username (required)
   - Add display name (optional)
   - Write bio (optional)
   - Upload photo (optional)
4. **Submit** → Firestore document created
5. **Navigate** → Home screen (placeholder)
6. **Future Logins** → Directly to Home (profile check passes)

### Returning User Journey

1. **Log In** → Firebase Auth
2. **Profile Check** → Fetch from Firestore
3. **Username Exists?** → Yes
4. **Navigate** → Home screen
5. **ProfileSetupScreen** → Never shown again

---

## ✨ Key Decisions & Patterns

### Username as Profile Gate

**Why?**

- Simple boolean check (has username = profile complete)
- Username is unique and permanent
- Required for user identification and search
- Single source of truth

**Alternative Approaches (Rejected):**

- Profile completion percentage (too complex)
- Multiple required fields (bad UX)
- Separate "isProfileComplete" flag (redundant)

### Optional Fields

**Display Name, Bio, Profile Picture are optional:**

- Don't block user from accessing app
- Can be added/edited later in Profile screen (PR #5)
- Better UX - only gate on essential info

### Graceful Degradation

**Image upload failure doesn't fail profile creation:**

```javascript
try {
  imageURL = await uploadProfileImage(userId, imageUri);
} catch (uploadError) {
  console.error("Failed to upload, continuing without image");
  // Profile creation continues with imageURL = null
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Tested Scenarios

- [x] New user signup → ProfileSetupScreen shown
- [x] Username validation (too short, invalid chars, already taken)
- [x] Display name optional (works with and without)
- [x] Bio optional (works with and without)
- [x] Profile picture picker (permission request, image selection)
- [x] Form submission with loading state
- [x] Firestore document creation
- [x] Navigation to Home after profile setup
- [x] Returning user login → skips ProfileSetupScreen
- [x] Error handling (username taken, network error)
- [x] Loading screen during profile check

### 🔄 Edge Cases Handled

- Username already exists → Error message shown
- Network failure → Error alert with retry option
- Image upload fails → Continue without image
- App closed during setup → ProfileSetupScreen shown on next login
- Multiple devices → Username uniqueness maintained
- Firestore offline → Works with cache, syncs later

---

## 🎯 Next Steps: PR #5

**User List & Presence Tracking**

What's coming next:

- Replace Home placeholder with real User List
- Fetch all users from Firestore
- Display users with avatars, display names, status
- Integrate Realtime Database for online/offline status
- Show "Last seen" timestamps
- Initialize presence on login
- Update presence on app state changes
- Test multi-device presence

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

### Strict Gating (Later PR)

Currently, ProfileSetupScreen is shown but not strictly enforced. Future enhancement:

```javascript
// Block ALL navigation without username
if (!currentUser.username) {
  // Prevent access to any main app screen
  // Only allow ProfileSetupScreen and Sign Out
}
```

### Profile Editing (PR #5)

Users will be able to:

- Edit display name
- Update bio
- Change profile picture
- Update status message

**Note:** Username is permanent and cannot be changed.
